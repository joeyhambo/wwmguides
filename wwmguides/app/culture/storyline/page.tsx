            Many people are asking: <strong className="text-white">WHY DID I TURN INTO A HORSE</strong> at the end of the first chapter (Qinghe main story)? In short, the Young Master did not turn into a horse, but you are experiencing through the POV of a horse. This is NOT the developers playing a prank; it is, instead, a metaphor filled with sorrow.

            This piece uses a literary technique commonly seen in Chinese traditions (Bai Miao) that paints scenes starkly through nouns. Picture a scene with the above nouns with you standing alone, leading a skinny old horse on an ancient road, with no clear path ahead and no way back home. Suddenly, memories of your hometown—its lively stream, tidy houses, and warm neighbors—flood in, deepening your loneliness. In this scene, the man and his horse together embody the ache of wandering away from home and nostalgia.

          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-4 text-white"><strong>3. The phrase "old Horse knows its way home" (老马识途)</strong></h2>
          <p className="text-gray-300 mb-4">
            This phrase comes from an ancient tale: A war lasted from spring to winter. When finally the army was victorious and heading home, they found the landscape altered and lost their way. Someone suggested: An experienced old horse will remember the path back. So they untied the horse's reins and let the horses lead, eventually found their way home.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-300 mb-4">
            With these cultural meanings of "horse" you're one step closer to grasping why you (temporarily) switched from MC to a horse!
          </p>
        </section>

        <section className="mb-12">
          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-4 text-white">Understanding the Scene</h2>
          <p className="text-gray-300 mb-4">
            Let's go back to that scene: From the color and pattern of the horse you turned into, it is not hard to tell that you were THE horse, "Clip-Clop." It was tamed by Yi Dao and given to Ruby as a present. But Ruby sacrificed herself to lead people out of the trap, and Yi Dao was consumed by flames to protect Young Master and the villagers. All those who came before are gone, and this parting is forever; only the mournful neighing of horse remains. Besides Ruby and Yi Dao, Aunt Han is nowhere to be found, the storyteller (and the majority) believes the Young Master has died together with Ruby, and from now on people in Blissful Retreat call MC a "stranger." The Young Master is now "isolated," and can talk to no one about the grief. The developers intentionally use the imagery of a horse to set a tone of quiet sorrow, implying the Young Master's unspeakable grief after the losses.
          </p>

          <p className="text-gray-300 mb-4">
            Maybe you've also noticed, when you became the horse, the quest name on the left of the screen was "Homeward Path." This echoes directly with the phrase "old Horse knows its way home." When MC shifts from Young Master into a horse without a rider/owner, it carries another layer of meaning: Even tough now that the Blissful Retreat is burned into ashes, as a child who grew up there, you don't need guidance to find your way home. You know where home is. The horse gallops urgently, just like Young Master wanting to get back after surviving the calamity. The horse can't think much, just like Young Master at that moment, with only one thought in mind: I MUST GO HOME.
          </p>

          <p className="text-gray-300 mb-4">
            Finally, let's put one more clue together: Please go to the appearance→mount section in WWM and check its description. "Clip-Clop has only ever been ridden by heroes." Ruby and Yi Dao are heroes. And after the "turned into a horse" scene, Clip-Clop has come to Young Master's side. On the night when Blissful Retreat burned down, Young Master bravely protected the villagers and witnessed Yi Dao's chivalrous act of "protecting with his life." Now riding Clip-Clop, Young Master carries on the meaning of hero. From this day forward, hometown is gone, leaving only the solitude and freedom of wandering Jianghu alone.
